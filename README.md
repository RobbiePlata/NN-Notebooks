# NN-Notebooks

My study of common methods and structures of neural networks using pytorch, also vectorization implementation.

Topics Covered:

Pytorch
- [Linear Regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobbiePlata/NN-Notebooks/blob/master/Linear%20Regression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
- [Fully Connected Linear Layers](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobbiePlata/NN-Notebooks/blob/master/NN%20Fully%20Connected/Basic%20NN.ipynb)

Vectorized
- [Logistic Regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobbiePlata/NN-Notebooks/blob/master/Vectorized/Logistic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
- [Deep Neural Network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobbiePlata/NN-Notebooks/blob/master/Vectorized/Deep%20Neural%20Network/Neural%20Network%20with%20L-layers.ipynb)
